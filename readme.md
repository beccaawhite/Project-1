# War Card Game

## About the game

A deck of cards is generated. Two decks are randomly shuffled between the computer and yourself. You play rounds by placing the top card of your deck in the middle. Whichever players card is greater in value will get both of the cards. If the two flipped cards are the same value, there will be a war. The next three cards are generated and the final card is compared. Whoever wins the war will get all 8 cards to add to their deck. Play rounds until one player has all the cards and is declared the winner.
